# frontend-mentor
I'm a novice frontend web developer, I've been watching tutorials for a couple of weeks,
reading documentation, among other things. I was lucky enough to find 
Dorian Desings' youtube channel, I already saw his HTML and CSS playlist,
I am missing the JavaScript one and some other interesting topics that he has uploaded.
His tutorials go from basic to advanced, in my case I am at a basic level,
thanks to his tutorials and the challenges that he proposes in his channel,
I managed to create my first project by myself using only HTML5 and CSS, in just a few days.
This is my first version, of course.
